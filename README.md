# Animating-COVID-19-Cases-by-County
I created this gif animation showing the number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people by county in the continental U.S over the period of June 16 - December 3 2020. 

Case data comes from the NY Times github at https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties.csv. Case data for some counties and dates is missing. 

County boundaries and population figures were taken from https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::usa-counties

I made this animation after following this tutorial: https://www.communityhealthmaps.org/blog/creating-a-covid-animation-through-time-with-qgis
